# 🌟 **Welcome to My PostgreSQL Projects Repository!**

## 👋 **Hello and Welcome!**

You can explore my collection of **SQL queries** written in **PostgreSQL**. Each project showcases different aspects of database management, query optimization, and insightful data analysis. 

🌟 **Have a great day exploring!**

## 📂 **What You'll Find Here**

### 📜 **SQL Query Highlights**
- Structured and optimized **SQL queries**.
- Implementation of advanced techniques such as:
  - `JOIN` operations.
  - `CASE WHEN` expressions.
  - Creation of `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY` constraints.
  - Filtering, grouping, and aggregation functions.
  - RFM Analysis
  - CAST and TOCHAR operations.

### 🛠️ **Database Design**
- Schemas built with **`CREATE TABLE`** statements.
- Logical relationships between tables using **ERD diagrams**.
- Sample data to demonstrate query functionality.

## 📊 **Visualizations**

👉 I shared some projects individually and also visualized them on **Power BI**. You can find their visualizations both in the project file I shared individually and in the **Power_BI_Projects** repo.

### 💡 Note:
Visualizations can also be replicated in **Excel**, but my preferred tool is **Power BI**.
